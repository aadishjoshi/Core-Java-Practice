To read and write data in file we use stream.

Reading sequence of bytes :- Input stream / java.io.InputStream.
Writing a sequence of bytes :- Output stream / java.io.OutputStream.

'Available' method lets us check the number of bytes that are currently available for reading.
int bytesAvailable = System.in.available();

We need to close the stream as stream uses OS resources that are limited in supply.

InputStream and Output stream read the files are arrays of bytes, but cannot read it as a datatype
such as string, int etc. For that we use DataInputStream and DataOutputStream which work well with
basic java datatypes.

FileInputStream f = new FileInputStream("something.txt");
DataInputStream d = new DataInputStream (f);
double s = d.readDouble();

RandomAccessFile lets you read/write data anywhere in the file. 
RandomAccessFile f = new RandomAccessFile("something.txt", "r"); //r for read, rw for write.
it has file pointer which will point at the position of the next record to be inserted.
